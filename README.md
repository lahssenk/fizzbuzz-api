# INTRO

This project contains a golang HTTP Server for a FizzBuzz API.

See [requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md) for a detailed specification of the API.

# RUN

The server reads a tiny configuration from environment variables:
- SERVER_HOST
- SERVR_PORT

## Go
```go run cmd/api/main.go```

## Docker
```docker build -t fizzbuzz . && docker run -rm fizzbuzz```

# DESIGN

The API is developped from a protobuf [contract](proto/fizzbuzz/v1/service.proto),
the service definition and request/response struct types are autogenerated using
protoc and stored [here](protogen/fizzbuzz/v1/).

I don't really like writing OpenAPI yaml spec by hand, therefor it is auto-generated from
the proto definition and annotations, and stored [here](openapi_v3/openapi.yaml).
